                    <h1>Task: Build a fully functional Game</h1>
                    <p>AdventureFox: GrapeHunt was the first game I ever built. It was a heavy school assignment and it
                        required us to build a fully functional game from 0.
                        Besides programming it, I created the concept, engineered the mechanics, desgined the graphic
                        elements, record and edit the sound effects and pretty much evverything that was needed for this
                        to work and be played.

                    <h3>Concept</h3>
                    <p>The Game is inspired by the old tale of the fox who would complain the grapes were sour because
                        he couldn't reach them.
                        I took a spin on that and build a game where the fox wants to push the limits and finally try to
                        get the grapes. Your mission is to help the fox prove that where there's a will, there's a way.

                <div id="mechanics">
                    <p>The mechanics of the game are pretty simple. You need to gather enough good grapes (purple) in 1
                        minute, to climb the ladder to the top. You can follow the progress on the ladded in the bottom
                        right corner.
                        You get 3 lives. Every time you click a bad grape (gree), you lose a life. If all lives are
                        gone,
                        you lost. No worries! Rome wasn't build in a day, and neither this game or you victory. Help the
                        fox
                        on its adventure to push the limits!

                    <h1>Case: Rebranding a Jewelry Store</h1>
                    <p>The Source is a sustainable jewelry store, based in Copenhagen, which aims to make more from
                        less,
                        and be enviornmetnal friendly at the same time. Our mission was to rebuild their brand image
                        based
                        on their values and vision. It had to be raw but refreshing. Elegant and simple but not your
                        typical
                        jewelry
                        store.</p>

                <img src="./images/gREEN 4.png" class="divider" alt="">

                <div class="concept">
                    <p>Our concept is, itself, pretty "raw". We decided to combine nature with jewelry, to send the
                        client to "The Source" of the product. When they wear our products, they start a journey, back
                        to the origins to say so.
                        They raw materials are strong, they inspire confidence, and they can only born the jewelry by
                        combining the forces, which a call for a community.</p>


                    <p>The design of the jewelry does not follow conventional patters, and neither did we. We built
                        graphic
                        elements inspired by wood sections to reflet the imperfect design of the collection and enhance
                        the beauty, while
                        keeping it elegant.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div id="solution">
                    <p> We decided to build a more lively and interactive website with a stronger contrast, which is why
                        we used a lot of
                        dark tones. We, however, balanced the design with a lot of white space. The graphics create good
                        dynamics and the images build a little mystery, which make people want to explore some more.
                        Every section has a call to action, every page has a different story, while keeping the design
                        consistent.</p>
                </div>

                <div id="solution2">
                    <p>
                        We built a new social media strategy, with a consistent posting algorithm, where we have ads as
                        stories that promote the collection. Both on stories and feed we have
                        "teaser" videos for the campaign, and, eventually, the main video. The purpose of posting on a
                        regular basis is to increase the online community and spread the word.
                        The main video was built with a short storyline and a clifhanger, so we keep our current clients
                        interested and curious, and attract new ones.</p>

                <div id="contribution">
                    <p>This is probably one of my dearest projects because I got the chance to work with some really
                        talented and devoted people. My personal contribution was mostly on the visual part.
                        I took care of everything that was related to the photo and video side, from building the
                        product
                        set to post processing.</p>

                    <p>Along creating the "endless" shaped, I also got to contribute with some
                        code
                        to the website and learned more on how to manage databases. Overall, I couldn't be more proud of
                        the
                        result, given the challenge.

                    <p>On this project I worked only on the configurator page. I created the elements needed for
                        adding/removing as well as the canvas car. The purpose was to make it functional so we chose not
                        to focus too much on the design. However, the page needed a lot of CSS so all the pieces go to
                        the right spot. After making sure everything looks good, I worked on JS and made it functional.

                    <p>The assignment itself was to build an item that can be configurated based on the user's
                        preferances. Our team has a common passion for the sport so naturally
                        we chose a F1 car. Around the configurator we built a website with a landing page and a F1
                        history page where we played with some animations.</p>
